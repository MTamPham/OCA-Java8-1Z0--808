/*
 * Array objects have the following public member:
 * - length - the variable stores the number of elements of the array
 * - clone() - the method overrides the method clone() defined in java.lang.Object but doesn't throw checked exceptions.
 * The return type of this method is the same as the array's type.
 * - Inherited methods - methods inherited from the class Object, except the method clone()
