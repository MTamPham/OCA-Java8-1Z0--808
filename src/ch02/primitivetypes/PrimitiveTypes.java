/*
 * Primitive data types are the simplest data types in a programming language.
 * A variable defined as one of the primitive data types is a primitive variable.
 * char - an unsigned numeric data type to store a single 16-bit Unicode character
 * byte - a signed numeric data type to store whole numbers of size 8 bits (-128 to 127)
 * short - a signed numeric data type to store whole numbers of size 16 bits (-32,768 to 32,767)
 * int - a signed numeric data type to store whole numbers of size 32 bits (-2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647)
 * long - a signed numeric data type to store whole numbers of size 64 bits (-9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807)
 * float - a signed numeric data type to store decimal numbers of size 32 bits
 * double - a signed numeric data type to store decimal numbers of size 64 bits
 * boolean -
 *
 * The default type of a non-decimal number is int. To designate an integer literal value as a long value, add the suffix L or l (in lowercase).
 * For octal literals, use the prefix 0; for the binary, use the prefix 0B or 0b; and for hexadecimal, use the prefix 0X or 0x.
 *
 * The default type of a decimal number is double. To designate a decimal literal value as a float value, add the suffix F or f (in lowercase).
 *
 * We can use underscores to group individual digits or letters of literal values makes them more readable.
 * The underscore can be placed right after the prefix 0, which is used to define an octal literal value but not after
 * other prefixes 0B, 0b, 0X, 0x, which are used to define a binary literal value or hexadecimal literal value, and D, d,
 * F, f, which are used to define a double literal value or float literal value
 * The underscore can't be placed at the beginning or the end of a literal value
 * The underscore can't be placed prior to an L suffix, which is used to define a long literal value
 * The underscore can't be placed adjacent to a decimal point
