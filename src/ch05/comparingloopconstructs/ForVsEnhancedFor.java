 * The regular for loop, although cumbersome to use, is much more powerful than the enhanced for loop:
 * - The enhanced for loop can't be used to initialize an array and modify its elements
 * - The enhanced for loop can't be used to delete the elements of a collection
 * - The enhanced for loop can't be used to iterate over multiple collections or arrays in the same loop
